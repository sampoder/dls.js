| `getParScore()`  | `getParScore()` calculates the par score for a team chasing in the second. When the second innings is cut short, this score can be used to determine whether they've won or not. | `overs`, `firstTeamScore`, `secondTeamOversPassed` & `secondTeamWicketsLost` |
| `getRevisedTarget(oversLost)`   | `getRevisedTarget()` calculates a revised target for the chasing team when overs are lost in the second innings. | `overs`, `firstTeamScore`, `secondTeamOversPassed` & `secondTeamWicketsLost`  |
